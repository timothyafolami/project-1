# Supervised Learning - Classification Method

The dataset was gotten from kaggle. It is quite a large data, and it is skewed in the sense that there are lesser people without heart diseases compared to those with it.
The data was visualized with the use of matplotlib and seaborn to gain insights into the data.
Neural Network was applied to correctly classify patients with heart disease or not based on their features (profile).
The model could achieve an accuracy 90% pom testing.




This is just a start, lots of projects are coming in soon.
